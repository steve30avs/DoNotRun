				* Attach this script to a GUITexture or GUIText to fix its scale to the aspect ratio of the current screen
				* Change the values of scaleOnRatio1 (units are in % of screenspace if the screen were square, 0f = 0%, 1f = 100%) to change the desired ratio of the GUI
				* The ratio is width-based so scaleOnRatio1.x will stay the same, scaleOnRatio1.y will based on the screen ratio
				*
				* The most common aspect ratio for COMPUTERS is 16:9 followed by 16:10
					* Possible aspect ratios for MOBILE are:
						* 4:3
							* 3:2
							* 16:10
							* 5:3
							* 16:9
